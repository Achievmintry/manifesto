# ChievMint (The Community is Stronk)

Recognition is good

* Build a Positive Community Culture.
* Fosters a Collaborative Buidl Environment.
* Increase Motivation

Every year there are groups and individuals that stand out as note worthy contributors. Many times doing their good work out of pure passion.

We think the greater community would like to recognize these extraordinary contributions with a talisman of appreciation, a premier award.

Besides that, individuals should be able to easily recognize members of their own communities and teams.


## The Ministry of Achievement
A single organization should not be in charge of issuing these awards so our solution is a 'dao of daos' comity.

We have 2 types of achievement awards

* **Premier Awards**: issued periodically, nominated by the dao, and voted on by the greater Ethereum community through snapshot votes.
* **1up Awards**: issued at anytime from one community member to another to recognize their awesomeness.

### The $CHEIV Token Snapshots

For Premier awards the DAO doesn't pick the winners, the community will pick the winners.  
> A token drop ($CHIEV) was initially made to all gitcoin donators. They are the givers, the dream/meme enablers. 

Further token drops will be made to members of joining DAOs, award winners, NFT artists, and contributors to the Ministry. TBD by DAO

### The Ministry of Achievement DAO
* The comity will be comprised of representative 'delegates' from DAOs across the Ethereum ecosystem. 
* Vote in or out 'delegates' from other DAOs.
* Manage admin functions around NFT minter.
* Manage and distribute $CHIEV token.
* Record, Validate and create awards, nominations and snapshots.
